2) JS on client and server.  SQL/MySQL vs MongoDB vs NoSQL?
   JS suggests MEAN  MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js.
   Angular is great for information flow in the UI.
   Node implementing server

3) Do you happen to know if YouTube has an API for playing segments of
   video, without popping up their ads, under code control?

   TV: Firefox will generate an event every frame. Chrome/IE/Opera
       every 200 or 250ms.

4) I found a dict.org thing at the GNU project, and I think they have
   gone obsolete, but dictionary lookup might sure be better into the
   cloud, so why not. Dictionaries, indeed a universal omnilingual
   dictionary database table structure and cloud-based storage and
   access system, are something to be thinking about.  Any thoughts?

   TV: Maybe take it over and use it within a derived-tier-generator
       algorithm.

5) Is there such a thing as ancient-script-learning OCR I can get my
   hands on and train up without being an expert?  ?

6) Does docinfo call out for improvements?
   character encodings per tier? DG: Let all be utf-8.
   Default display methods per URL locator type? TV: define them in the browser.

7) Am I stupid for not just going to the feet of the AG project and
   learning all their wise lessons?  Bird's NLTK, I read over
   recently, a bit of it, which was inspiring. Python, I guess.
     TV: maybe!
